# Memories
Full Stack MERN application with Google OAuth and JWT
Using React, Node.js, Express & MongoDB I've built a Full Stack MERN Application. The App is called "Memories" and it is a simple social media app that allows users to post interesting events that happened in their lives.
Setup:
- run ```npm i && npm start``` for both client and server side to start the app
